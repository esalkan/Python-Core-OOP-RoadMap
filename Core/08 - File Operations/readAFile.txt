Goodnight your Highness
The seat is now empty
And your subjects have gone to pay homage
The phantom King's story is read
By the court astrologer
The jester is entertaining
With the joke of the year

The King is in the counting house
Somehow he got in the counting house
The Queen is in the parlour
Eating bread and honey
The rest are in the barn
